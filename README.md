## **Types of data**

- ***Quantitative***
    
    → Numerical .. can apply mathematical operations on
    
    → number of something ( cats )
    

- ***Contiguous***
    
    → has infinite number of corresponding values
    
    ex: F(x) = 2x .. or any measured quantity that can be divided into infinite number of small parts .. like age in years, months, weeks, days... 
    

- ***Discrete***
    
    → has specific number of corresponding values
    
    ex: number of cats 
    
    ---
    

- ***Categorical***
    
    → labels of a groups or sets of data 
    
    - ***Ordinal***
        
        ranked ( degrees like A+ A B+ B ... )
        

- ***Nominal***
    
    not ranked ( people -لا للتنمر- )

## **Analyzing quantitative data**

- ***Four aspects***
    - [📎](Descriptive%20Statistics%2024ef0f41fe8a4d45b8d5918a78c843b5.md) Measure of center
    - [📎](Descriptive%20Statistics%2024ef0f41fe8a4d45b8d5918a78c843b5.md) Measure of spread
    - [📎](Descriptive%20Statistics%2024ef0f41fe8a4d45b8d5918a78c843b5.md) The shape of the data
    - [📎](Descriptive%20Statistics%2024ef0f41fe8a4d45b8d5918a78c843b5.md) Outliers
    
    ---
    

## **Measures Of Center**

- ***Mean*** → Sum/Count
    
    ex: 1 2 3 4 5 → mean = 15 / 5 = 3
    
- ***Median*** → the items at the middle of the set after sorting
    
    ex: 5 6 8 9 2 → Sorted view: 2 5 6 8 9 → **median = 6**
    
    ex: 5 6 8 9 2 4 → Sorted view: 2 4 5 6 8 9 → **median** = 5,6 = (5+6)/2 **=** **5.5**
    
- ***Mode*** → Item(s) having the most repeated value
    
    
    no mode for the data sets having values that all are repeated the same number of times 
    
    ex : 1 1 2 2 3 3 → no mode
    
    one mode 
    
    ex: 1 1 2 3 4 → mode = 1 
    
    many modes 
    
    ex: 1 1 2 2 3 → modes 1,2 ( both occurred twice )
    
    ---
    

> ***Notations***
> 
- Representing an object or something using a symbol
- ex: X as a placeholder for someone’s age or some other attribute

- Rows ans columns
    - Columns : Variable X
    - Rows : Instance or Individual x(n)

> ***Example***
> 
- Summation notation
    
    For column X .. x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 + ... x5, is represented using the sigma notation $\sum$
    
    $\sum^n_{i=1}x(i)$ where n = 100

## **Measure Of Spread**

how spread out our data are from one another 

- $Common\;measure\;of\;spread\;include$
    - [Range](Descriptive%20Statistics%2024ef0f41fe8a4d45b8d5918a78c843b5.md)
    - [Interquartile range](Descriptive%20Statistics%2024ef0f41fe8a4d45b8d5918a78c843b5.md)
    - [Standard deviation](Descriptive%20Statistics%2024ef0f41fe8a4d45b8d5918a78c843b5.md)
    - [Variance](Descriptive%20Statistics%2024ef0f41fe8a4d45b8d5918a78c843b5.md)

### **Range and Interquartile Range**

> ***5 Numbers Summary***
> 
- Gives us values for calculating **Range** and **Interquartile range**
- These numbers are
    - Max
    - 3rd quartile
    - 2nd quartile ( $Median$ )
    - 1st quartile
    - Min

- $Range$
    - Difference between $Max$ and $Min$

- $Interquartile\;Range$
    - Difference between $Q_1$ and $Q_3$
    
    ---
    

> ***Example***
> 
- Find the 5 number summary for: 5 8 3 2 1 3 10 105

- **Sorting**: 1 2 3 3 5 8 10 105
- $Q_2$ ( $Median$ ): 3,5 = 4
- Min = 1
- Max = 105

- Finding $Q_1$ and $Q_3$
    - $Q_1$ from the first half before $Median$
        
        1 2 3 3: $Q_1$ = 2,3 = 2.5
        
    - $Q_3$ from the second half after $Median$
        
        5 8 10 105: $Q_3$ = 8,10 = 9
        

- remember, we use the 5 number summary to calculate range, Interquartile range
    - $Range$ = $Max$ - $Min$ = 105 - 1 = 104
    - $Interquartile\;Range$ = $Q_3$ - $Q_1$ = 9 - 2.5 = 6.5
    
    ---
    

> ***Python Code calculating the five number summary***
> 
- A method `Median` takes a list and returns its median
- Called this method for finding the median of each half created after getting the median of the original list .. and wallah .. take care of the generated five number summary
    
    ```python
    class data_analysis:
        @staticmethod
        def Median(n:list):
            if len(n) %2 == 0:
                m1_index = (len(n) / 2) - 1
                m2_index = m1_index + 1
                m = ( n[int(m1_index)] + n[int(m2_index)] ) / 2
            else:
                m_index = (len(n)+1) / 2 - 1
                m = n[int(m_index)]
            return m
        
        @staticmethod
        def five_number_summary(numbers:list):
            sorted_list = sorted(numbers)
    
            max = sorted_list[-1]
            min = sorted_list[0]
    
            if len(numbers) %2 == 0:
                m1_index = (len(sorted_list) / 2) - 1
                m2_index = m1_index + 1
                m = ( sorted_list[int(m1_index)] + sorted_list[int(m2_index)] ) / 2
                q1 = data_analysis.Median(sorted_list[0:int(m1_index)+1])
                q3 = data_analysis.Median(sorted_list[int(m2_index):])
            else:
                m_index = (len(numbers)+1) / 2 - 1
                m = sorted_list[int(m_index)]
                q1 = data_analysis.Median(sorted_list[0:int(sorted_list.index(m))])
                q3 = data_analysis.Median(sorted_list[int(sorted_list.index(m))+1:])
    
            return f"Five Number Summary:\n max: {max}\n min: {min}\n 1st quartile: {q1}\n 2nd quartile (Median): {m}\n 3rd quartile: {q3}\n range: {max-min}\n Interquartile range: {q3-q1}"
    ```
    
    - Test Case:
    
    ```python
    from data import data_analysis as da
    
    l = [1,5,10,3,8,12,4,1,2,8]
    
    print(da.five_number_summary(l))
    ```
    
    - *Output*
    
    ```
    Five Number Summary:
     max: 12
     min: 1
     1st quartile: 2
     2nd quartile (Median): 4.5
     3rd quartile: 8
     range: 11
     Interquartile range: 6
    ```

> ***Box Plot***
> 
- Visualizing data using the five numbers summary
- Used to quickly compare the spread of two data sets

### ***Standard deviation and Variance***

> ***Standard Deviation***
> 
- The average distance of each observation from the mean

> ***Variance***
> 
- Average square difference of each observation from the mean
    
    

> ***Example***
> 
- For the following data set: 1 5 10 3 8 12 4

- mean = $\frac{Sum}{Count}\;=\;\frac{43}{7}\;=\;6.14$
- differences squares from mean
    
    $(1 - 6.14)^2\;=\;(-5.14)^2\;=\;26.45$
    
    $(5 - 6.14)^2\;=\;(-1.14)^2\;=\;1.299$
    
    ... 
    
- Sum of diff squares: $94.86$
- **Variance** = $\frac {Sum\;of\;diff\;squares}{Count}\;=\;\frac{94.86}{7}\;=\;13.55$

- ***Standard deviation***: $\sqrt{Variance}$ = $\sqrt{13.55}\;=\;3.68$

> ***Notes***
> 
- It’s better to use the standard deviation as it has the same units of the original data while variance has squared units
- Standard deviation is used to compare the spread of data in different data sets
- High standard deviation value → high risk
- Fare comparison requires same units

## Shape Of Distribution

- How to use histograms to determine shape associated with data

- Normal Dist
    - also called the bell curve
    - Mean = Median = Mode
    - ex: Heights, weights

- Right skewed - Left skewed
    
    ![Image](https://github.com/aIqasem/Descriptive-Statistics-Basics/blob/main/attachments/Untitled.png)
    
    - Right → Mode $<$ Median $<$ Mean “بتذيد وانت رايح يمين”
        - ex: time until light bulb dies
    - Left  → Mode $>$ Median $>$ Mean “بتذيد وانت رايح شمال”
        - ex: Grades of students, age of death
    
    ---
    

## Outliers

- Points that falls very  fat away from the rest of the data
- better to use five number summary rather than mean and standard deviation

### *Identifying outliers*

- Note they exist and the impact on summary statistics
- If typo (error), Remove or Fix
- Understand why they exist and the impact on question we are trying to answer
- Reporting the five number summary (better than mean and standard deviation)
- Be careful, Know how to ask the right questions

### *Outliers advises*

- Plot your data to identify if you have outliers
- If no outliers:
    - use mean and standard deviation to describe your data set, and report that the data are normally distributed
- If there are outliers:
    - Use the five number summary, and report the outliers

## Descriptive statistics VS Inferential statistics

- Descriptive statistics
    - Is about describing our collected data
- Inferential statistics
    - Is about using our collected data (samples) to draw conclusions to a larger population

- Important definitions
    - Population: our entire group of interest
    - Parameter: numeric summary about a population
    - Sample: subset of the population
    - Statistic: numeric summary about a sample
    

> ***Example***
> 
- A school has 100,000 student
- We want to know how many students drink coffee
- We send e-mails to all students asking whether they drink coffee or not
- 5000 student replied

- Sample: The 5000 reply is representing our sample
- we found that 73% of our sample drinks coffee
- Statistic: 73%
- Parameter: the numeric summary concluded from the statistic of the sample
